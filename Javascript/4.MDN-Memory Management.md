### Introduction
Low-level languages, like C, have low-level memory management primitives like malloc() and free(). On the other hand, JavaScript values are allocated when things (objects, strings, etc.) are created and *"automatically" freed* when they are not used anymore. The latter process is called *garbage collection*.

### Memory life cycle
1. Allocate the memory you need
2. Use the allocated memory (read, write)
3. Release the allocated memory when it is not needed anymore

### Garbage collection
#### References
The main notion garbage collection algorithms rely on is the notion of *reference*
#### Reference-counting garbage collection
This is the most naive garbage collection algorithm.
This algorithm reduces the definition of *"an object is not needed anymore"* to *"an object has no other object referencing to it".*
An object is considered garbage collectable if there is *zero reference* pointing at this object.

#### Mark-and-sweep algorithm
This algorithm reduces the definition of "an object is not needed anymore" to *"an object is unreachable"*.
