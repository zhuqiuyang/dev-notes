### What made Lisp different?
http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html
1. Conditional
2. function type
3. Recursion
4. A new concept of variables
5. GC
6. Programs composed of expressions
7. a symbol type
8. A notation for code: using tree of symbols
9. The whole language always available:
- Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp's syntax;
- running code at compile-time is the basis of macros;
- compiling at runtime is the basis of Lisp's use as an extension language in programs like Emacs;
- and reading at runtime enables programs to communicate using s-expressions, an idea recently reinvented as XML.
