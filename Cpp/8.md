### Variables
data
- create variable, store in the memoery: stack or heap.(later how memory actually works)
- variables do occupy the memory, where we store the data in memory.
size:
- the compiler tell how big the type is.

#### Primitive data type:

`integer` is 4 byte (32 bit)
- range: -2b ~ 2b (billion), -2^31 ~ 2^31.
- 1 bit represent positive or negative.

`unsigned` means it's always positive

`char` 1 byte data
- character `A` is number `65`
```cpp
char a = 65;
cout << a
// A
short b = 65;
cout << b
// 65
```
`short` 2 byte data
`long` 4 byte data (depend on the compiler)
`long long` 8 byte

> The usage of data types is just up to the programmer really there are conventions that we have in place but there's nothing concrete that you have to actually follow there
> 
> Ther only diff between these data types is **how much memory will allocated** when you create a variable with that type.

Decimal type:

`float` 4 byte, `double` 8 byte:
```cpp
float var1 = 5.5;
// actually var1 is a double
// how to discern:
float var2 = 5.5f;
```

`bool` 1 byte: true or false
- why not 1 bit? Because we can use address.

`sizeof` can check the size(byte)

The ability turn them into pointers or references.
- pointer: write a `*`(asterisk) after your type
- reference: by a `&` (ampersand) next your type

Pointer and ref are huge and complicated and vital topics.(Later video)

### 9.Funcions
input -> output
return value
- `void` no return

```cpp
int Multiply() {
  return 5 * 8;
}

void MultiplyAndLog(int a, int b) {
  cout << Mulply(a, b); 
}
```

You should be aimed to split up your code to many many functions.
But go overboard you don't need a function for absolute every line of code that's not good for anyone.It's hard for maintain your code.

And It's make your program slower:
> Every time we call a funciton, ask compiler generates a call instruction what is basically means is that in running a program in order for us to run a fuction we need to create entire stack frame for the function meaning we have to push things like the parameters onto the stack, we have to also push something called returned address onto the stack, and then what we do is we jump to a different part of binary in in order to start executing the instructions from our funcion and that return value that we need push we need get back to where we originally were before we call the functions.So this is called like jumping around memory in order to execute function instructions and all of that takes time, so it slow down the program.

> Now the reason i said asterisk earily was because this is all assuming that the compiler decides to keep our functions as an actual function and doesn't inline it.

> We are going to talk about in depth inlining in a future.

####  The primary point of function is to Prevent code dublication.

The main funciont and only the main function is except from `must return a value`, if it doesn't specify a return, it'll add 
```cpp
return 0;
```

Function is useful. Every program is build from a collection of functions.s

####
Break up function into declarations and definitions
- declarations we usually store in header files
- definitions we write in translation unit or cpp files
