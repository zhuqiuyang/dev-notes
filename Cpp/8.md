### Variables
data
- create variable, store in the memoery: stack or heap.(later how memory actually works)
- variables do occupy the memory, where we store the data in memory.
size:
- the compiler tell how big the type is.

#### Primitive data type:

`integer` is 4 byte (32 bit)
- range: -2b ~ 2b (billion), -2^31 ~ 2^31.
- 1 bit represent positive or negative.

`unsigned` means it's always positive

`char` 1 byte data
- character `A` is number `65`
```cpp
char a = 65;
cout << a
// A
short b = 65;
cout << b
// 65
```
`short` 2 byte data
`long` 4 byte data (depend on the compiler)
`long long` 8 byte

> The usage of data types is just up to the programmer really there are conventions that we have in place but there's nothing concrete that you have to actually follow there
> 
> Ther only diff between these data types is **how much memory will allocated** when you create a variable with that type.

Decimal type:

`float` 4 byte, `double` 8 byte:
```cpp
float var1 = 5.5;
// actually var1 is a double
// how to discern:
float var2 = 5.5f;
```

`bool` 1 byte: true or false
- why not 1 bit? Because we can use address.

`sizeof` can check the size(byte)

The ability turn them into pointers or references.
- pointer: write a `*`(asterisk) after your type
- reference: by a `&` (ampersand) next your type

Pointer and ref are huge and complicated and vital topics.(Later video)
