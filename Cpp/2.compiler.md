#### stage1: pre-processor
1. `#include` just copy
2. `#if #endif` eval

#### stage2: compile cpp code to machine code

The gist of how a compiler work:
it will take our `source files` and output and `.obj file` which contains machine code and other constant data that's we defined.
And we got these obj file, and we can `link` them into one excutable which contain all of the machine code that we actually need to run.
