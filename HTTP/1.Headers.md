Headers can be grouped according to their context:
- General header
- Request header
- Response header
- Entity header

Headers also can be grouped according to how proxies handle them
- End-to-end headers: Intermediate proxies must retransmit end-to-end headers unmodified and caches must store them.
- *Hop-by-hop* headers: These headers are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection and must not be retransmitted by proxies or cached. Such headers are: `Connection, Keep-Alive, Proxy-Authenticate, Proxy-Authorization, TE, Trailer, Transfer-Encoding and Upgrade`. Note that only hop-by-hop headers may be set using the Connection general header.
