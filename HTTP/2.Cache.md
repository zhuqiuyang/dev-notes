### Different kinds of caches
 When a web cache has a requested resource in its store, it *intercepts* the request and returns its copy instead of re-downloading from the originating server
 - private cache
 - share cache

### Control cache
#### cache-control header
- no-cache: A cache will send the request to the origin server for validation before releasing a cached copy.
- public: The *public* directive indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.

#### Etag
- If the *ETag* header was part of the response for a resource, the client can issue an *If-None-Match* in the header of future requests
- The *Last-Modified* response header can be used as a weak validator, the client can issue an *If-Modified-Since* request header to validate the cached document

### Vary
- 根据某一个header的值分类进行 cache; It can use for cache content for Desktop/mobile user by *User-Agent* header.
